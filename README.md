Thanks to the “Commune of Scientific Engineers” platform of idea exchanging in the Institute of physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the AI-Curve of ScienceAI subproject has been completed. This tool makes an AI implementation of the simple and repetitive work of scientists: opening PDF, grasping the key graph curve and converting it into original datasheet, sending and receiving email. This work has been published as a chapter in the ebook <<Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering>> and available online for free download: https://doi.org/10.3233/atde220079 . If any user in the world needs to digitize the curve, he just needs to send an email scienceai@sina.com , including the keyword "curve" in the title and attaching the pure curve picture (a JPG file) or the original PDF file, then you will soon receive an automatic reply from ScienceAI.
